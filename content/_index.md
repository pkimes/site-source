I am currently a senior statistical scientist at Genentech in South San Francisco, CA, USA. My interests lie broadly in using data to improve human health and advance our understanding of disease. At Genentech, I split my time between supporting oncology early development (clinical studies through phase II) and personalized healthcare (PHC) initiatives across the R&D pipeline. 

Before moving to Genentech, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) in data sciences at the [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). I received my PhD in statistics at the [University of North Carolina](https://stat-or.unc.edu/) with Professors [Yufeng Liu](http://www.unc.edu/~yfliu/), [J.S. Marron](http://marron.web.unc.edu/), and [D. Neil Hayes](https://hayeslab.lab.uthsc.edu/) where I worked on problems in statistical (machine) learning and bioinformatics. Between graduate school and joining the Irizarry lab, I spent two years as a bioinformatician with Roche Diagnostics. My undergraduate degree in mathematics was completed at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) with Professor [Jo Hardin](https://research.pomona.edu/johardin/).
