I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) in biostatistics and computational biology at the [Data-Farber Cancer Institute](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/) and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). I received my PhD in statistics at the [University of North Carolina](https://stat-or.unc.edu/) with Professors [Yufeng Liu](http://www.unc.edu/~yfliu/), [J.S. Marron](http://marron.web.unc.edu/), and [D. Neil Hayes](https://hayeslab.lab.uthsc.edu/). I completed my BA in mathematics at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) with Professor [Jo Hardin](https://research.pomona.edu/johardin/), and naturally, a fan of liberal arts colleges. 

My research interests lie broadly in the development of [statistical methods](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UBYy1J0AAAAJ) and accompanying [computational tools](http://github.com/pkimes) (most often in R) for processing and analyzing data related to human health and biology. Most often, this has involved working with data generated by modern high-throughput technologies for molecular biology.
